## Loading the Docker Compose data

Download the sample Docker Compose file by executing the below commands.
```
mkdir -p samples/docker-compose
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/move2kube-demos/main/samples/docker-compose/single-service/docker-compose.yaml -P samples/docker-compose```{{execute}}

The downloaded sample Docker Compose file is `docker-compose-2-kubernetes/samples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml`{{open}}

In the next step, we will translate this Docker Compose sample using Move2Kube and generate the target deployment artifacts.
