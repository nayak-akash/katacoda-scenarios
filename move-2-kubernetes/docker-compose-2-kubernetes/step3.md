## Translate

To generate the target target artifacts, execute `move2kube translate -s samples/docker-compose/`{{execute}}

Move2Kube goes through each and every file and tries to analyze and understand each one of them. Then it tries to interact with you whenever it has a doubt. It creates the plan for you internally and then will come back to you when it has some doubts.
